# Comparative Analysis of SQL Injection Detection and Prevention Techniques in Database Management Systems
Comparison of SQL Injection detection using 12 ML/DL models (CNN-LSTM, BiLSTM, Random Forest, etc.) on 10k query SQLiV3 dataset. A combination of CNN-LSTM provided high accuracy, recall, with latency trade-offs. It includes the Jupyter notebook and results table with plots for security analysis of the DBMS.\
